android_devenv_installer
========================

Sets up an Android development environment on Debian Jessie



This is a fork of https://gist.github.com/tahl/1026610.
I made some modifications in order to make this script work on my Debian Jessie (the original script is written for Linux Mint).

At the moment this script has to be considererd rather crude and undone. However, you can at least use it to install the sdk, ndk and the udev rules.
